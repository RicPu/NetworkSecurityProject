[[ Report ]](report/main.pdf) [[ Presentation ]](presentation/Presentation.pptx)

This project implements a comparison between traditional TCP/TLS and QUIC protocols through custom-build client-server applications, specifically designed for file transfer.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
To set up the project with a Conda environment, follow these steps:

- Create and activate the Conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda create --name protocol-comparison python=3.12.8
    conda activate protocol-comparison
    ```

- Clone the repository and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RicPu/NetworkSecurityProject
    cd NetworkSecurityProject
    pip install -r code/requirements.txt
    ```

## üöÄ Usage
To get started, run the servers first from this directory. The private key and certificate will be generated automatically when the server starts and they will be saved in `code/assets`.

- To start the TCP+TLS server, run the following:
    ```bash
    python code/src/TCP-TLS_server.py
    ```

- To start the QUIC server, run the following:

    ```bash
    python code/src/QUIC_server.py
    ```

### üìä Benchmark
When executing the clients, the benchmark evaluates the performance of the two protocols by measuring key metrics such as handshake time, round-trip time (RTT), and file transfer throughput. Both the TLS and QUIC implementations follow a similar workflow, but they use diffent underlying protocols (TCP for TLS and UDP for QUIC).

#### Workflow
When you run either the TLS or QUIC benchmark script, the following steps are performed:

1. **Handshake Test**: Measures the initial connection setup time.

2. **Ping Tests**: Measures Round-Trip Time (RTT) for small payloads. Calculates average RTT and standard deviation.

3. **File Transfer Tests**: The client first sends a 10MB test file (`test_upload.bin`) to the server, measuring upload time and throughput. Then, it requests a sample file (`Summer_1.jpg`) from the server, measuring download time and throughput.

4. **Results Display**: Prints a summary report with average metrics for handshake time, RTT, upload/download times and throughput. This includes detailed breakdowns for each iteration of uploads, downloads, and ping tests.

#### Usage
To execute the benchmarks, run the clients from this directory.

- To start the TCP+TLS client, run the following:
    ```bash
    python code/src/TCP-TLS_client.py
    ```

- To start the QUIC client, run the following:

    ```bash
    python code/src/QUIC_client.py
    ```

### üì¶ Packet Capture and Analysis
This project includes two scripts for benchmarking and analyzing network performance using the PyShark library. These scripts capture and analyze packets during QUIC and TCP+TLS communication, providing insights into handshake times, Round-Trip Times (RTT), and file transfer performance.

#### Usage
To execute the packet capture and analysis, run the modified clients from this directory.

- To start the TCP+TLS client, run the following:
    ```bash
    python code/src/pyshark/pyshark_tcp_client.py
    ```

- To start the QUIC client, run the following:

    ```bash
    python code/src/pyshark/pyshark_quic_client.py
    ```
